# Pathways

### .container Files

A react component where the data is queried and passed down as props to its children components

### .graphql Files

These files define the query to the database. The fields can be found within data-access schema files, or with using the apollo explorer extension

### Molecules

Reusable components that can be used for other ECFMG/Intealth apps (connected apps)

### Shared

Reusable components/data structures that are used in other components within the project folder.
