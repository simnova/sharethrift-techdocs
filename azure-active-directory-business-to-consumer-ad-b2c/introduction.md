# Introduction

We made custom policies for the user flow journeys. AD B2C provides a base policy which is the basic user journey but to change that journey we need custom policies.

Custom policies are designed with the help of base policy but no changes are made to the base policy. A custom policy is an XML document that can be fully configured according to business needs.

Custom policies help in customizing everything, starting from claims, then UI,  then User Journeys, then Orchestration Steps, and at last the technical profile. (Check the link at the end to understand what these steps entail)
